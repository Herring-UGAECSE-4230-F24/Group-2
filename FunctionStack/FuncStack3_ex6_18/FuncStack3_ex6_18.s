@ Deliverable 1: Describe how the str instructions work in myFunc.
@ Deliverable 2: Describe how the ldr instructions work in myFunc.
@ Deliverable 3: What are the values of R0, R1, and R2 after the program runs?
@ Deliverable 4: Replace the str and ldr instructions in myFunc with the appropriate (least number) push and pop instructions.  Show your code.
